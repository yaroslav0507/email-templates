  K&amp;L Wine Auctions Seller Terms &amp; Conditions of Auction Sale
</p>

<p>
  Sellers are required to thoroughly read the <a
    href="{$BaseLinkUrlKey}/Auction/Information/AuctionInfo.aspx?section=TermsAndConditions#TermsAndConditions">K&amp;L
    Wine Auctions Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale</a> and the Seller Terms and Conditions, which describe the terms
  governing the purchase of all property sold at auction. Sellers must agree to all the Terms and Conditions of Auction
  Sale and the Seller Terms and Conditions in order to participate in K&amp;L Wine Auctions.
</p>

<p>
  "K&amp;L," "K&amp;L Wine Merchants," "we," or "our" refers to K&amp;L Wine Merchants, the owner of the K&amp;L Wine
  Auction web site. "Seller," "you" or "your" refers to the person or entity that is the seller of record.
</p>

<p>
  Sellers are prohibited from bidding on their own items and/or taking any action to increase the bid on their lot.
  Sellers who knowingly submit counterfeit wines for auction or misrepresent their items will also be subject to penalty
  and held liable for any legal action taken by a Buyer in response to such fraudulent activity.
</p>

<p>
  Wines may ONLY be purchased AND/OR sold by and delivered to persons who are at least twenty-one (21) years old in the
  United States or such other minimum age as is required in foreign jurisdictions ("Legal Age"). Customer represents
  that: (1) Customer is at least of Legal Age; and (2) the person to whom any wine will be delivered is also of Legal
  Age. At the time of delivery, any domestic U.S. shipment containing an alcohol beverage product will require the
  signature of an adult possessing identification proving he or she is at least twenty-one (21) years old.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-brand inline-block">**</span>SELLER'S COMMISSION
  K&amp;L Wine Merchants is entitled to deduct and retain a Seller's Commission from the proceeds as the result of an
  auction lot sale, which is calculated as a percentage of the final gross purchase price. The Seller's Commission shall
  be fifteen percent (15%) of the lot purchase price. If the Seller wishes to receive K&amp;L store credit, the Seller
  Commission will be waived.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-brand inline-block">**</span>EXPENSES
  Seller will be responsible for expenses related to shipping the auction lot items to the K&amp;L San Carlos,
  California fulfillment center. These fees, if applicable, will be deducted from Seller's final payment. Seller may
  also drop off his or her auction lot items free of charge at any of our K&amp;L locations in Redwood City, San
  Francisco or Hollywood, California. If K&amp;L determines the wine unfit for auction upon receiving it, Seller may be
  held responsible and charged for all outstanding shipping fees, including those incurred in the lot's return.
</p>

<p>
  Seller will also be charged a five dollar ($5) listing fee per lot, which will be deducted at the time of final
  payment.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-brand inline-block">**</span>DETERMINING STARTING BID &amp; RESERVE PRICE
  The "Starting Bid" is the agreed upon opening bid price for an auction lot. To determine the appropriate Starting Bid,
  K&amp;L Wine Merchants consults a variety of auction databases with current pricing information on wines sold at
  auction. Current trends and market conditions may also be taken into consideration. The Starting Bid will be confirmed
  in this Seller Agreement.
</p>

<p>
  A Reserve is the minimum price at which K&amp;L guarantees your lot will sell. If your lot does not include a Reserve,
  any bid at or above the Starting Bid must be accepted by the Seller. Bidders are aware if a Reserve exists, but the
  exact Reserve will not be published on your lot. If your lot has a Reserve, K&amp;L may exercise the right to bid on
  the lot until the Reserve is met.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-brand inline-block">**</span>SELLER AGREEMENT PROCESS
  K&amp;L requires Sellers to complete a two-fold agreement process, which includes a preliminary agreement before
  auction items are sent to K&amp;L for inspection, and a final agreement post inspection to confirm the starting bid,
  reserve and length of auction. Both signed agreements are required before an auction lot will go live on the K&amp;L
  Wine Auction web site. Once the final Seller Agreement has been signed, Seller may be subject to penalty fees for
  withdrawing the lot from auction. (See "Transfer of Title to Buyer").
</p>

<p>
  Please note, by signing the Seller's Agreement, Sellers agree not to disclose K&amp;L Wine Merchant's proprietary
  auction pricing information to any third parties.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-brand inline-block">**</span>INVENTORY INSPECTION
  K&amp;L requires the inspection of Seller auction items prior to the auction start date to verify wine names,
  quantities, bottle size, label condition, fill levels, cork and capsule condition, and overall authenticity. Once K&amp;L
  has received the Seller's lot items, they will be compared against the original lot description and initial agreement
  terms to determine if the starting bid and/or reserve price are still appropriate. K&amp;L reserves the right to alter
  the initial Seller Agreement after the inspection process. Seller will be required to consent to any changes in the
  agreement before proceeding to auction.
</p>

<p>
  Sellers who knowingly submit counterfeit wines for auction or misrepresent their items will also be subject to penalty
  and held liable for any legal action taken by a Buyer in response to such fraudulent activity.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-brand inline-block">**</span>LIABILITY FOR LOSS WHILE AUCTION LOT ITEMS IN K&amp;L WINE MERCHANTS' CUSTODY
  While in possession of auction lot items, K&amp;L assumes responsibility for insuring such items against loss by
  theft, fire, or by any causes beyond K&amp;L's reasonable control. When the auction lot items are either shipped to
  the Buyer or returned to the Seller, K&amp;L Wine Merchants assumes no responsibility for the shipment. Please note
  that wine shipments cannot be insured against loss resulting from hot or cold temperatures; we strongly suggest using
  either accelerated shipping methods, or delaying shipments until weather conditions are moderate.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-brand inline-block">**</span>TRANSFER OF TITLE TO BUYER
  Title to the auction property will not pass from Seller to Buyer until full payment for items is received by K&amp;L
  Wine Merchants. Since the sale of the wine between Seller and Buyer takes place at K&amp;L Wine Merchants' Northern
  California facility, the Buyer becomes the owner of the wine at the time of final payment. Seller will be notified
  once this transaction has taken place.
</p>

<p>
  In an auction with Reserve, Seller may withdraw his or her lot at any time before completion of sale. In an auction
  without reserve, after the auction begins, Seller cannot withdraw his or her lot unless no bid has been made within a
  reasonable time.
</p>

<p>
  In either a Reserve or non-Reserve auction, Sellers who withdraw their lots after signing the final Seller Agreement
  will be subject to a processing fee equivalent to fifteen percent (15%) of the Starting Bid as well as any outstanding
  shipping costs and listing fees.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-brand inline-block">**</span>SELLER PAYMENT
  Upon completion of the auction, Seller will get a notice of the winning purchase price and may choose to receive a
  check for the lot sold, less commission and fees, or K&amp;L Wine Merchants store credit. Sellers will receive their
  payment within thirty (30) days of the auction end date, if not sooner, sent to Seller's chosen address.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-brand inline-block">**</span>CURRENCY
  All K&amp;L Wine Merchants auctions are conducted in U.S. Dollars ($). The credit card of each winning bidder will be
  charged in U.S. Dollars ($) and Sellers will also receive a check in U.S. Dollars ($).
</p>
