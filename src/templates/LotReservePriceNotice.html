				<center><b>K&amp;L Wine Auctions Seller Terms &amp; Conditions of Auction Sale</b></center>
				<br/><br/>
				Sellers are required to thoroughly read the <a href="{$BaseLinkUrlKey}/Auction/Information/AuctionInfo.aspx?section=TermsAndConditions#TermsAndConditions">K&amp;L Wine Auctions Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale</a> and the Seller Terms and Conditions, which describe the terms governing the purchase of all property sold at auction. Sellers must agree to all the Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale and the Seller Terms and Conditions in order to participate in K&amp;L Wine Auctions.
				<br/><br/>
				"K&amp;L," "K&amp;L Wine Merchants," "we," or "our" refers to K&amp;L Wine Merchants, the owner of the K&amp;L Wine Auction web site.  "Seller," "you" or "your" refers to the person or entity that is the seller of record.
				<br/><br/>
				Sellers are prohibited from bidding on their own items and/or taking any action to increase the bid on their lot. Sellers who knowingly submit counterfeit wines for auction or misrepresent their items will also be subject to penalty and held liable for any legal action taken by a Buyer in response to such fraudulent activity.
				<br/><br/>
				Wines may ONLY be purchased AND/OR sold by and delivered to persons who are at least twenty-one (21) years old in the United States or such other minimum age as is required in foreign jurisdictions ("Legal Age"). Customer represents that: (1) Customer is at least of Legal Age; and (2) the person to whom any wine will be delivered is also of Legal Age. At the time of delivery, any domestic U.S. shipment containing an alcohol beverage product will require the signature of an adult possessing identification proving he or she is at least twenty-one (21) years old.
				<br/><br/>
				**SELLER�S COMMISSION<br/>
				K&amp;L Wine Merchants is entitled to deduct and retain a Seller�s Commission from the proceeds as the result of an auction lot sale, which is calculated as a percentage of the final gross purchase price. The Seller�s Commission shall be fifteen percent (15%) of the lot purchase price. If the Seller wishes to receive K&amp;L store credit, the Seller Commission will be waived.
				<br/><br/>
				**EXPENSES<br/>
				Seller will be responsible for expenses related to shipping the auction lot items to the K&amp;L San Carlos, California fulfillment center. These fees, if applicable, will be deducted from Seller�s final payment.  Seller may also drop off his or her auction lot items free of charge at any of our K&amp;L locations in Redwood City, San Francisco or Hollywood, California. If K&amp;L determines the wine unfit for auction upon receiving it, Seller may be held responsible and charged for all outstanding shipping fees, including those incurred in the lot�s return.
				<br/><br/>
				Seller will also be charged a five dollar ($5) listing fee per lot, which will be deducted at the time of final payment.
				<br/><br/>
				**DETERMINING STARTING BID &amp; RESERVE PRICE<br/>
				The "Starting Bid" is the agreed upon opening bid price for an auction lot. To determine the appropriate Starting Bid, K&amp;L Wine Merchants consults a variety of auction databases with current pricing information on wines sold at auction. Current trends and market conditions may also be taken into consideration. The Starting Bid will be confirmed in this Seller Agreement.
				<br/><br/>
				A Reserve is the minimum price at which K&amp;L guarantees your lot will sell. If your lot does not include a Reserve, any bid at or above the Starting Bid must be accepted by the Seller. Bidders are aware if a Reserve exists, but the exact Reserve will not be published on your lot. If your lot has a Reserve, K&amp;L may exercise the right to bid on the lot until the Reserve is met.
				<br/><br/>
				**SELLER AGREEMENT PROCESS<br/>
				K&amp;L requires Sellers to complete a two-fold agreement process, which includes a preliminary agreement before auction items are sent to K&amp;L for inspection, and a final agreement post inspection to confirm the starting bid, reserve and length of auction.  Both signed agreements are required before an auction lot will go live on the K&amp;L Wine Auction web site. Once the final Seller Agreement has been signed, Seller may be subject to penalty fees for withdrawing the lot from auction. (See "Transfer of Title to Buyer").
				<br/><br/>
				Please note, by signing the Seller�s Agreement, Sellers agree not to disclose K&amp;L Wine Merchant�s proprietary auction pricing information to any third parties.
				<br/><br/>
				**INVENTORY INSPECTION<br/>
				K&amp;L requires the inspection of Seller auction items prior to the auction start date to verify wine names, quantities, bottle size, label condition, fill levels, cork and capsule condition, and overall authenticity. Once K&amp;L has received the Seller�s lot items, they will be compared against the original lot description and initial agreement terms to determine if the starting bid and/or reserve price are still appropriate. K&amp;L reserves the right to alter the initial Seller Agreement after the inspection process. Seller will be required to consent to any changes in the agreement before proceeding to auction.
				<br/><br/>
				Sellers who knowingly submit counterfeit wines for auction or misrepresent their items will also be subject to penalty and held liable for any legal action taken by a Buyer in response to such fraudulent activity.
				<br/><br/>
				**LIABILITY FOR LOSS WHILE AUCTION LOT ITEMS IN K&amp;L WINE MERCHANTS� CUSTODY<br/>
				While in possession of auction lot items, K&amp;L assumes responsibility for insuring such items against loss by theft, fire, or by any causes beyond K&amp;L�s reasonable control.  When the auction lot items are either shipped to the Buyer or returned to the Seller, K&amp;L Wine Merchants assumes no responsibility for the shipment.  Please note that wine shipments cannot be insured against loss resulting from hot or cold temperatures; we strongly suggest using either accelerated shipping methods, or delaying shipments until weather conditions are moderate.
				<br/><br/>
				**TRANSER OF TITLE TO BUYER<br/>
				Title to the auction property will not pass from Seller to Buyer until full payment for items is received by K&amp;L Wine Merchants. Since the sale of the wine between Seller and Buyer takes place at K&amp;L Wine Merchants� Northern California facility, the Buyer becomes the owner of the wine at the time of final payment. Seller will be notified once this transaction has taken place.
				<br/><br/>
				In an auction with Reserve, Seller may withdraw his or her lot at any time before completion of sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auction begins, Seller cannot withdraw his or her lot unless no bid has been made within a reasonable time.
				<br/><br/>
				In either a Reserve or non-Reserve auction, Sellers who withdraw their lots after signing the final Seller Agreement will be subject to a processing fee equivalent to fifteen percent (15%) of the Starting Bid as well as any outstanding shipping costs and listing fees.
				<br/><br/>
				**SELLER PAYMENT<br/>
				Upon completion of the auction, Seller will get a notice of the winning purchase price and may choose to receive a check for the lot sold, less commission and fees, or K&amp;L Wine Merchants store credit. Sellers will receive their payment within thirty (30) days of the auction end date, if not sooner, sent to Seller�s chosen address.
				<br/><br/>
				**CURRENCY<br/>
				All K&amp;L Wine Merchants auctions are conducted in U.S. Dollars ($). The credit card of each winning bidder will be charged in U.S. Dollars ($) and Sellers will also receive a check in U.S. Dollars ($).
